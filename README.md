# Vedette
 Monitor and terminate CPU hogging processes in iOS

Vedette is a CPU usage monitoring tweak for processes in iOS like apps and daemons, and terminate it when they violate the maximum allowed percentage. 

One example is the *trustd* issue that's happening on both macOS and iOS. More info on this issue can be found on this excellent article written by Jeff Johnson
[here](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/trustd.html).

## Compatibility
This package tested to be working on iOS 14.3. Might or might not work on other iOS version. Though, I *think* it should work on iOS 10 and above. Due to the low level API used are supported since iOS 10.

## Bonus
Vedette is NOT cabaret as how Google's first search result show, and definately not the hot girl shown.
